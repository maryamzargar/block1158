<p>Upper West Side, among other neighborhoods in New York City, has been subjected to many

changes over that past century. From a lunatic asylum on one corner to an intellectual and 

cultural hub on another Upper West Side has undergone some drastic shifts that essentially have 

shaped the neighborhood’s character. We learn that even today, the neighborhood is subjected 

to further change, despite the numerous effective neighborhood coalitions that the residents of 

the community have formed. While change in the context on New York City is inevitable, who in 

the community it affects and how it unfolds make it essential to study. The study looks at the 

overall changes in the Upper West Side while mostly focusing on the southern side of the 

neighborhood where the Lincoln Square is located. Furthermore, the study is conducted while 

considering historical, socio-political and economic factors that influenced the physical structure 

of the neighborhood from 1940s to the current day. </p>

  <h2> The San Juan Hill </h2>
<p> In the late 1950’s the area from 60th to 65th Streets between Amsterdam Avenue and the 11th 

Avenue railroad tracks, was San Juan Hill. It was largely an Afro-American and Puerto Rican 

neighborhood. San Juan Hill was one of the largest and poorest African-American neighborhoods 

in Manhattan before the rise of Harlem. It was at this time that the African-American population 

exodus to Harlem and a wave of Puerto Rican residents moved in. The gang activities and the 

poor conditions of the neighborhood inspired Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim write 

the West Side Story in the late 1950’s. In 1955 John D. Rockefeller 3rd, one of the principal 

contributors, began with funds for planning of Lincoln Center.</p>

  <h2>Urban Renwal</h2>
  <p> In 1960 the construction of Lincoln Center as a large ‘urban renewal’ project led by Robert 

Moses resulted in some of the African Americans living in the area to be moved to the 

Amsterdam Housing Projects on the far West side; the rest were displaced completely. The 

neighborhood that once was the cradle of jazz in New York City had then disappeared.

Juan Hill and the birth of Lincoln Center. Consequently, a total of 40,000 people were displaced by 

the means of eviction as result of this large urban renewal project. Many of the changes during 

this time is essentially due to vision of one man with an immense political power who 

consequently changed the face of many neighborhoods in NYC. Robert Moses who “got things 

done”, I must add in very large scale, began to lose his reputation as the discussion around urban 

planning shifted towards a smaller scale approach to planning. The notion of neighborhoods and 

community planning then became a priority due to efforts of Jane Jacobs and her instrumental 

publications.</p>

  <h2>Single Occupancy Residences</h2>
<p>In 1970 Upper West Side saw an influx of mentally ill throughout the community and the market 

for Single Occupied Residents (SRO) arose. Later in the decade the Lincoln Amsterdam Housing 

Apartments were also constructed. After the J-51 tax abatement became available in New York, 

SRO units began to disappear quickly, particularly in gentrifying neighborhoods like the Upper 

West Side. The displacement of permanent tenants eventually became so severe that in 1973 

the Mayor, John Lindsay, established a unit, Mayor’s Office of SRO Housing, to only manage the 

needs of SRO tenants. The unit’s responsibilities were to monitor and inspect SROs while

advising the Mayor on policy issues related to SRO housing and advocating on behalf of SRO 

tenants with sub-standard living conditions who faced eviction and harassment.</p>

  <h2> Upper West Side </h2>
<p> In 1980’s a short-lived freight railroad, called the Miller Railroad, was nearby over 12th Avenue. 

It later became the elevated West Side Highway which was demolished in the same decade. 

These elevated structures reportedly helped make the extreme West Side a haven for violence.

It was in 1990 that Upper West Side received its first historic designation limiting construction in 

those zones. Since then, neighborhood organizations such as Landmark West! continued to add 

many more buildings and areas to the list of designated landmarks and historic zones. By doing 

so, they have work to protect these buildings from insensitive change and demolition.

In 2006, as a result of transfer of development rights, the owners of the synagogue located on 

the Lincoln Square agreed to swap location on the lot to make room for a new apartment tower 

to be built by Continental Properties. The developer in turn delivered a new synagogue with 

better facilities on the new location 250 feet away from the old synagogue. The Lincoln Square 

Synagogue is array of other buildings that has been approached by a developer to apply TDR for 

further development. A recent proposal concerning Air Rights of another historic building is the 

example of Shearith Israel farther up in Upper West Side. In this case the community groups 

fought to preserve the contextual zoning of the area. The project has been put on hold after 

numerous attempts by the developer through the Board of Standards and Appeals to propose a 

proper proposal that meets the community’s demands. Mayor De Blasio in 2015 proposed two zoning amendment requiring Mandatory Inclusionary 

Housing for new development and a Zoning for Quality and Affordability to essentially lead to 

FAR increase in certain zones and consequently allow for more senior and affordable housing. 

Although both proposals were opposed by the majority of the community boards in NYC and 

caused a citywide controversy during they ULURP review, they were both passed with some 

modification in March 2016 by City Council. While the zoning amendments do not impact Upper 

West Side as much as other neighborhoods they would have some ramifications nonetheless.</p>
